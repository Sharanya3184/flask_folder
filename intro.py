        <p>Hi, good afternoon. I am Sharanya R from Vellore.</p> 
        <p>I am currently pursuing my Bachelor of Computer Applications at Auxilium College (Autonomous), Katpadi.</p>

        <p>I completed both my SSLC and HSC at Shanthinikethan Matric Higher Secondary School, Vellore.</p>

        <p>I have completed an internship at Aura Harks Technology Pvt. Ltd. as a Software Developer Trainee, where I gained hands-on experience in form validation, responsive design for mobile view, and backend development.</p>

        <p>During this time, I worked on two real-time projects: a Clinic Booking System and a Personalized Mentor Platform. 
        I was involved in both frontend and backend development.</p>

        <p>Additionally, I performed manual testing to ensure functionality and reliability.</p>
        <p>My core skill is Python, and Iâ€™m continuously learning and improving in this domain.</p><br>

           
        <center><p>***Thank you for giving me this opportunity to introduce myself.***</p><center>
